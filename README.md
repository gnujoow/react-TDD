# react TDD

this repo is personal practice for react TDD(Test driven development). the test is built with  
- [MochaJS](https://mochajs.org/)
- [Chai-jquery](https://github.com/chaijs/chai-jquery)
- [Chai](http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/)

This project has been carried out while taking to [Advanced React and Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux-tutorial/learn/v4/overview) I am not familiar with node.js so I forked [this repositroy](https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter) and wrote the code.

```
$ npm start
